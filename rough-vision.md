# Overview

Pokémon Snap High Score Challenge is simply a twist on the community's traditional speedrunning tournament. As the Pokémon Snap community also has a few high score runners, a tournament catered to them would be fun for all involved.

# Execution
Two possible tournament methods are possible, Classic or Mission.
In both cases, everyone joins a singular race, with the victor becoming the champion.

## Classic
Given 30 minutes and starting from an empty file, get the highest score possible.

## Mission
Given 20 minutes and starting from a completed file, get the highest total score possible for the list of Pokémon for this event.
There will be bonus points for having the top score for any individual Pokémon.
The list of Pokémon will be the same for all participants for any individual Challenge.

### Scoring
- Highest total score: 50 points
- 2nd: 50 - max(Participant Count * 2, 6)
- 3rd: 50 - max(Participant Count * 3, 10)
- 4rd: 50 - max(Participant Count * 4, 12)
- 5th: 50 - max(Participant Count * 5, 14)
- ...

The participant with the highest score for each individual Pokémon will receive 5 points (e.g. if 6 top scores, +30 points).

# Requirements
- Each participant will require a completed file for Mission, marking down the individual scores for each Pokémon that pictures are taken of
- Each participant must stream their attempt
- A Tournament Organizer (TO) must review each attempt at the end of the time expiration, and ensure all rules are followed before validating runs
